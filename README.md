First thing is first, I'm happy to see this theme spirit and commitment. I believe we will be successful on this project. Good luck!!! These are the guidelines to follow in our development journey. Our naming standard should follow the Pascal Case. The Models and ViewModels should be included in the folder structure initialized. In the case of controllers and Views, it is better to include some prefix based on our directorates i.e

    Crime case controllers and views should be prefixed cr,
    Civil case controllers and views should be prefixed cc,
    Corruption case controllers and views should be prefixed co and
    Economy case controllers and views should be prefixed ec
    The primary key of each class should be labeled as class name plus Id.
    The data type of primary keys should be GUID.
    Every folder other names we provide are expected to be labeled in Pascal case (Make The first letter of the word capitalized).
    Instead of sex use the term Gender.
    Put your Enums in the enum folder only. The button color is better to follow,
    Create button -> success
    Edit button -> warning 
    Details button -> info
    Delete button ->danger

Rules to follow in Git change

    Everybody should work on his branch if not he is not allowed to push at any time.
    If we want to push, be sure to sync or pull to get the latest updated git repo first before pushing our contribution. Have a nice coding!!!!!!!!!

First thing is first, I'm happy to see this theme sprit and commitment. I believe we will be successfull on this project. Good luck!!!
These are the guidlines to to follow in our development journey.
Our naming standard should follow the Pascal Case.
The Models and ViewModels should include in the folder structure initialized.
In case of of controllers and Views, it is better to include some prefix based on the category i.e 
1. Crime case controllers and views should be prefixed cr,
2. Civil case controllers and views should be prefixed cie,
3. Corruption case controllers and views should be prefixed co and
4. Economy case controllers and views should be prefixed ec  
The button color is better to follow,
1.  Create button <btn-success>
2. Edit button <btn-warnning>
3. Details button <btn-info>
4. Delete button <btn-danger>

Rules to follow in Git change
1. Everybody should work on his own branch if not it is not allowed to push at any time.
2. If we want to push, be sure to sync or pull to get the latest updated git repo first before pushing our update our contribution.
Have a nice coding
